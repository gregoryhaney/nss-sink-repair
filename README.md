<h1 align="center">Maude and Merle's Sink Repair</h1>

<p align="left">This project was done as part of the coursework in my full-stack web developer bootcamp at Nashville Software School (NSS). It uses HTML with CSS. It is my first exposure to using APIs and using a form to gather data from a user. The application allows a customer to enter data into four fields (job description, worksite address, budget, and required completion date) and submit the work order. This causes an API POST to the database. When the employee works on the ticket, they can mark it as complete, which is indicated in the UI adjacent to the completed job description. In the UI, all tickets in the database are listed; the employees have the ability to delete tickets upon demand, using a 'delete' button adjacent to the job description.</p>
